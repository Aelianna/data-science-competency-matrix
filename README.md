# DRAFT Data Science Competency Matrix

This is a draft version of a competency matrix in the field of data science. I'm not sure it's ready for general consumption, but I figured I'd post it anyway. It heavily borrows from many different places over the years and I've not kept good enough track of the myriad sources unfortunately.

please also note that this is not necessarily applicable to every situation; it is more focused on larger and well-established teams within an organization and may not be as relevant for smaller business, teams, or startups.

I'd appreciate any suggestinos as well. Thanks!
